NOTE: in this document we use the following definitions for cross compiling[1]:

 * host: platform where everything will be compiled. usually
   i386/i686/amd64/x86_64+Linux or Mac.
 * target: platform which will run the resulting binary. arm+Android in this
   case.

Getting stuff:
=============

Compiling Bigloo for Android requires several things:

 (Install all this as a subdierctory of the same directory. This will make
 configuration simpler).

 * Android SDK[2].
 * Android's source code (Warning: it's a big download). Follow these[3]
   instructions.
 * Download droid-wrapper[4]. The command is:
   'git clone git://github.com/tmurakam/droid-wrapper.git'. Then apply
   version-linker.diff shipped in this directory and install.

Also you will require:

 * An already compiled and running bigloo version for the host platform.


Configuring:
===========

Copy 'arch/android/config-local.sh.sample' into 'arch/android/config-local.sh'
and edit it. Point ANDROIDROOT to the directory where you downloaded and
decompressed all the Android tools, and BS_BIGLOO to the dir where the host
bigloo resides.


Compiling:
=========

You will need an Android 2.0 (ecalir) or newer device running. This can be a
real phone with USB debugging turned on (you can turn it on when you plug in
the USB cable; we at least know Motorola Droid/Milestone and HTC Desire can do
it) or any device emulated in the SDK's emulator. You can test with SDK's
'tools/adb logcat' wether you can connect to the device. If you can't,
'killall adb'[5], fix whatever is wrong and try again.

Then you can simply run:

   ./arch/android/build-android.sh configure

If everything's ok, then you can compile:

   ./arch/android/build-android.sh build

If everything's ok, then you can install[6]:

   make install


Notes:
=====

The current version assumes you're using Android SDK r07, which decompresses in
a directory called 'android-sdk-linux_x86'. If you're using another version and
the path changes (in r04 it was 'android-sdk-linux' and in r06 it was
'android-sdk-linux_86') , edit 'arch/android/config.sh' to reflect the change,
and please let us know.

    changes.
