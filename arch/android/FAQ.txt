Q: Why doesn't Bigloo have threads support under android?
A: Long story short, the gcc used to compile it declares 'Thread model:
   single'. Boehm's GC considers it as anon-thread-supporting platform,
   so it compiles without threads.

Q: How do I enable USB Debugging in my Android phone?
A: Home-> Menu-> Settings-> Applications-> Development-> USB Debugging.
   We also recommend 'Stay awake'.

Q: I plugged in my phone with USB Debugging on, but when I try to
   configure Bigloo it says that it could not contact the Android device.
A: It could be that you don't have enough permissions on the USB devices.
   You could try to set a udev rule to give you enough permissions.
